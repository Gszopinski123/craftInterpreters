### Challenges
1. I checked out CPython. The Lexer(scanner) is found here: <link>(https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/main/Parser/lexer) and The Parser is found here <link>(https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/main/Parser)
2. Reasons to not use JIT: you may lose some abilities/features in your language, it may become harder to implement features, you are completely dependent on what the user has as a machine.
3. you may need to quickly test features.
